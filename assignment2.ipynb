    "**Q1 Answers**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** The paper is about data cleaning. More specifically, Wickham argues that data tidying is one of the easier ways to take messy datasets to be ready for manipulation, modeling, visualization, and analysis. The data tidying structure goes as such: \"each varaible is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.\" (Wickham 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** The \"tidy data standard\" intends to accomplish a systematic and consistent way to organize data, prior to analysis. This is not only helpful for the one conducting the analysis, but also ensuring that the data cleaning process can be replicated for future projects/researchers/data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** For the first sentence, it means that because tiny data sets are systematically cleaned in the same fashion, they have the commonality that makes them easy to follow with the same structure. Messy datasets are messy in their own way because they have each an unique way in which the data was recorded, errors, etc. and therefore have their own idiosyncrasies that are hard to follow. For the second sentence, Wickman means that while you can define the variables and observations, it is hard to figure out in what ways you want to comapre these/assign these in a comprehensible/logicial way. For example, Wickman is saying it can be hard to know where to put these variables and observations: make them the columns or rows. He then says: \"A general rule of thumb is that it is easier to describe functional relationships between variables (e.g., z is a linear combination of x and y, density is the ration of weight to volume) than between rows, and it is easier to make comparsion between groups of observations (e.g., average of group a vs. average of group b) than between group of columns.\" (Wickman 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** Wickman defines \"values\" as being either numbers (quantitative) or strings (qualitative) that are then organized in two ways. A \"variable\" then is something that \"contains all values that measure te same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units.\" (Wickman 4) Lastly, Wickman defines \"observation\" as such: \"An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes.\" (4)\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.** Wickman defines tiny data as such: \"1. Each variable forms a column. \\n 2. Each observation forms a row. \\n 3. Each type of obeservational unit forms a table.\" (4)\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.** The 5 most common problem with messy datasets are 1. \"Column headers are values, not variable names.\", 2. \"Multiple variables are stored in one column.\", 3. \"Variables are stored in both rows and columns.\", 4. \"Multiple types of observational units are sotred in the same table.\", and 5. \"A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\" (Wickman 5). Table 4 is messy because it has three variables, religion, income, and frequency, with the column header is a value and not a variable name. Therefore, the data needs to be \"melted,\" which is when one take sthe columns and turns them into rows. This is done by making \"a list of columns that are already variables (colvars) and then making the other columns and making two variables: a new araible called column that contains repreated column headings and a new variable called value that contains the concatenated data valeus from the previously seperated columns.\" (Wickman 6) It is like taking \"height\" and \"weight\" columns and making one \"variable\" column that then has the either \"height\" or \"variable\" as the categorical values under that \"variable\" column, with then a \"value\" column to the right that denotes the actual value of the corresponding variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7.** Table 11 is messy because the colvars, id, year, and month, are all seperated into different columns, as well as containing a lot of missing values that take a lot of space in the table that can be cleaned up. Table 12(a) therefore is molten because it took the three variables that denoted time, year, month, and dx (dx = date one, or first day of month, etc.), and made a date column, with each row having a recorded data recorded. Then the element has either the tmax or tmin, with then the right corresponding column as the \"value\" for that corresponding element. Table 12(b) makes it \"tiny\" because \"Each row represents the meteorological measurements for a single day. There are two measured variables, minimum (tmin) and maximum (tmax) tempature: all other varialbes are fixed.\" (Wickman 11). \n",
    "\n",
    "**8.** The chicken-and-egg progems is \"if tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be inextricably linked to tidy data.\" (Wickman 20) Essentially it can cause one \"to get stuck in a local maxima where independently changing data structures or data tools will not imporove workflow.\" (Wickman 20) Wickman therefore hopes that future developers/statisticans/whoever can \"build on this framework to develop even better data storage strategies and better tools.\" (22) "

    "**Q5 Answers**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** The 2020 US Census gathered data on race by 6 categories: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and lastly Some Other Race (for people who do not identify with any of the OMB race categoies.\" (https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2021/08/measuring-racial-ethnic-diversity-2020-census.html) These data were self-reported and an individual was able to chose from any of these 6 categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** We collect these data because it helps for the government to understand the demographic makeup of the country to help in particular with civil rights, racial descrimination, hate crime data, criminal data, etc. Race in the U.S. is also a particular salient identity, and it has been a topic of many of legislation including but not limited to: education inequality, income inequality, crime, etc. Therefore, the quality of the data really matters in order to make correct policy decisions and helping correct stakeholders in society to make decisions, including education accessibility, hiring, racial diversity in neighborhoods, etc. If this race data's quality is poor, this can have negative affects on policy decisions and those who make decisions in the private sector, such as executives or even hiring managers, as information acquisition is an important part of decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** In terms of what was done well, I think that they tried to include some understanding of complexity on the racial categorization with the Some Other Race. I think that they also at least had some different categories of race. It seems that they  I think that one of the biggest categories that could be adjusted was the Asian one. Asia is an extremely diverse continent as well as makes up a large part of the entire world's population, and so I think it is not able to capture this diversity/complexity by just having Asian. Perhaps it can be categories as \"Southeast Asian\", \"East Asian\", and \"Western Asia\" (this being the Middle East), \"North Asia\", etc. By breaking up in this way, it can better capture, I think, the complexity and diversity of this Asian racial category. I think a further description of then what all these different categories with perhaps even a map and of course input from those who identify as these different races can help researchers have a better, richer understanding of their measurement of race. Hopefully, a restructuring of this data collection can be implemented and adopted by other research/data collection, to help capture and understand the world better. \n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** The Census gathered data on sex by having a checkbox that gave the person two options: Male or Female, in which they can check one. In terms of gender, there was no data collected on this metric. I think that this could be improved by creating another question and then having gender as a selection, which could include things like nonbinary, transgender, genderfluid, gender non-conforming, woman, man, etc. Moreover, for the sex category, an intersex category could be included to get information on the sex makeup of the US.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**5.** When it comes to cleaning data, one concern I might have is that there could be a lot of data that is either left empty or filled out incorrectly, mostly to people being unsure about how to fill out these characteristics, or might accidently check something they might not actually identify with. I think it is easier to probably clean data with less racial/sex/gender/etc. categories, which might be a reason may researchers try to limit categories, but might miscalculate the severity of this data-collection decision. When there are missing values, I could forsee data getting ommited, which might actually be problematic for understanding the true makeup of a population. A bad practice therefore that might occur is that they just get rid of these categories or underestimate their impact on what they are trying to understand, which can affect their findings and the residual impacts of their research (policy, etc.) A good practice might to try to best explain and outline what these categories are in the survey for those being surveyed and then trying to not omit these categories when clean data as much as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**6.** I would have some concerns about the accuracy of the data that was recorded, as those who would fill out these surveys could incorrectly put down their correct identification. Moreover, because minorities within these categories make up less of the population, my concern is that the algorithm might not include enough representation in whatever is being predicted. I could see that a model, like using race as a category and predicting the likelihood of getting a particular diagnosis for example, could be problematic since some racial groups might have different health concerns or risks, such as African Americans and the likelihood of having sickle cell disease.
